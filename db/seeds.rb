This shit got me in my feelings
Gotta be real with it, yup
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin' you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it
Trapmoneybenny
I buy you champagne but you love some Henny
From the block like you Jenny
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many
'Resha, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
J.T., do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Two bad bitches and we kissin' in the Wraith
Kissin'-kissin' in the Wraith, kiss-kissin' in the Wraith
I need that black card and the code to the safe
Code to the safe, code-code to the safe-safe
I show him how the neck work
Fuck that Netflix and chill, what's your net-net-net worth?
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
(Yeah, yeah)
And I'm down for you always
D-down for you always
D-d-down for you always
(I got a new boy, and that nigga trade)
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want you, and I need you
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave
From beside me, 'cause I want ya, and I
Bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back
B-bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back
Shawty say the nigga that she with can't hit
But shawty, I'ma hit it, hit it like I can't miss
(Clap that ass, you're the only one I love)

I'm doing this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey baby come on
I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I want to see you out that door
Baby bye bye bye
Bye bye Don't want to be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye
Bye bye
Don't want to make it tough
I just want to tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye
You just hit me with the truth
Now girl you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason
Baby come on
I've lived for you and me
And now I really come to see
That life would be much better once you're gone
I know that I can't take no more
Ain't no lie
I want to see you out that door
Baby bye bye bye
Bye bye Don't want to be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye
Bye bye
Don't want to make it tough
I just want to tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye
I'm givng up I know for sure
don't' want to be the reason for your love no more
Bye bye
I'm checking out, I'm signing off
Don't want to be the loser and I've had enough
Don't want to be your fool in this game for two
So I'm leaving you behind
(Bye bye bye)
I don't want to make it tough
(Make it tough)
But I've had enough
(Bye bye)
And it ain't no lie
Bye bye Don't want to be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye
Bye bye
Don't want to make it tough
I just want to tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye
